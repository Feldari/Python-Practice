'''
This program will take a provided list and reverse it
without using negative numbers in the list's index
(lstvar[::-1]), any pre-existing methods or functions
that reverse lists ( reverse(lstvar) ), or a reversed
range ( range(10,0,-1), or any other process of 
'counting down' in the list's index).

Input:
User is expected to provide a list via a statically
assigned variable in the code.

Output:
We would expect the program to print the list backwards.

ex.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  would print as [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
