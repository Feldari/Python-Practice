The collatz conjecture (AKA Hailstone Numbers)
The basis for this is that a user will provide a number
And that number if even will be divided by two (n / 2), if odd
It will be multiplied by 3 and have 1 added to it (3n + 1)
Then repeat with the given output.
Eventually the number will converge to 1 which is
When the program should stop.

Input:
User provides an integer

Output:
Program will print each number result as it works its way to 1

Ex. What Number to Process?: 6
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
Done!
