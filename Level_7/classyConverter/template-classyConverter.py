This program is an example of how to use classes and
object orened programming!

Prompt:
Build a program that utilizes classes to store multiple converted values for a given number.

The class should have paramaters for each of the stored bases (Base 2, 8, 10, and 16)
This class should have methods for the 4 basic mathematical opperations (+, -, *, and /).
This would mean that <class1> + <class2> should return a class object that contains the
results of that operation in all common bases (bases 2, 8, 10, 16)

There should be a method to update the classes' stored number. the user should be able
to specify the base of the entered number.

There should be a method to print all stored values.

Optional stretch Goal:
Implement logging via the logging module


Input:
User will enter numbers and their bases as well as menu items

Output:
Program will return a list of stored numbers or the 
result of basic mathemetical opperations
