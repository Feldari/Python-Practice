# Python-Practice

This will be a place to store practice problems for Python. There will be varying levels of problems available looking at different required skills.

Challenges are broken down into levels. Each level assumes you have some base subset of tools from the python toolkit. As a stretch goal, try implementing tools from upper skill levels against lower level practice problems. See if doing so makes the program more efficient.

Also implementing things like input validation, error handling or logging is another way to expand on these practice problems.

The expected tools are as follows:

## Level 1

Variables, if, elif, and else statements, print(), type()

Basic data types: Integers, Strings, Floats, Boolean

Basic Math: +, -, \*, /, +=, -=, \*=, /=

## Level 2

While and For Loops, range(), len(), str(), int()

Intermediate Data Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries

Intermediate Math: \*\*, //, %

## Level 3

Command line arguments, external file reading, substring parsing, importing default modules

All other data types not previously mentioned

All other math operators not previously mentioned

## Level 4

User generated Functions and Modules, input validation, error handling

if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_'

## Level 5

External File writing and handling, Logging

## Level 6

Connecting to external resources over a network

## Level 7

Utilizing self built classes, list comprehensions, and any other Python tool or module not previously mentioned
