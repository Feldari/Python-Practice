'''
Create a program capable of discerning the results of the quadratic formula for a user given a, b, and c.

Input:
User will provide an A, B and C value.

Output:
The program will return the possible solutions to the formula

Ex. 
Provide an A: 2
Provide a B: 4
Provide a C: -6

Solutions are: 1,-3

###

NOTE: to be able to use a square root you will need to add 'import math' to the top of the program,
and to call a square root call it with math.sqrt(#)

example:
square root of 25 is 5 in python this would look like this

math.sqrt(25)

This will return 5 when executed after the import statement
'''
import math

# Collect a, b, and c from the user

# if a is 0 print "No Solution" and exit

# Solve for the discriminant
    # If 4*a*c is greater than b*b print "No Solution" and exit

# Save solution 1 with + solution

# Save solution 2 with - solution

# compare solution 1 and 2
# If solution 1 is the same as solution 2 print only one answer
# else print both solutions
