'''
Create a program capable of discerning the results of the quadratic formula for a user given a, b, and c.

Input:
User will provide an A, B and C value.

Output:
The program will return the possible solutions to the formula

Ex. 
Provide an A: 2
Provide a B: 4
Provide a C: -6

Solutions are: 1,-3

###

NOTE: to be able to use a square root you will need to add 'import math' to the top of the program,
and to call a square root call it with math.sqrt(#)

example:
square root of 25 is 5 in python this would look like this

math.sqrt(25)

This will return 5 when executed after the import statement
'''

import math
